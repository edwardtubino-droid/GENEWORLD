# Game Design Document: "Nova‚Äôs Genetic Quest"

## 1. Storyline
Play as **Nova**, a young scientist exploring the mystical **Genelands** to unlock the secrets of genetic engineering. Your goal: **assemble the ‚ÄúPerfect Genome‚Äù** and save a rare, endangered species.

## 2. Core Gameplay Loop

- **Explore** maps and interact with hotspots.
- **Answer science-based questions** to test and grow your knowledge.
- **Collect special genetic items** (DNA fragments, enzymes, plasmids, etc.).
- **Evolve** into more advanced scientific forms with improved abilities.
- **Manage stamina/lives**: Correct answers boost, wrong answers reduce.
